A NeoPixel ring controlled by a DHT11 sensor and an Arduino Nano can be a fascinating project that combines temperature sensing with visual feedback. This article will guide you through the process of building such a system.

**Materials Needed**
Arduino Nano
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
Neo Pixel Ring
Jumper Wires

**About 8-bit neo-pixel ring**:
5V power supply to drive the RGB lamp ring
8 super bright smart NeoPixels LED arranged in a 28mm outside diameter circular PCB
Intelligent reverse connection protection, reverse power connection will not damage the IC
IC control circuit and LED point light source share a power supply
Control circuit and RGB chip are integrated into a 5050 packaged component to provide a complete external control pixel
Built-in signal reshaping circuit
After each pixel receives the signal, it undergoes waveform shaping and then outputs, so that the waveform distortion of the line will not accumulate.
Built-in power-on reset and power-off reset circuits
Each pixel of the three primary colors can achieve 256 brightness levels, or 16M colors full-color display, and scan frequency not less than 400Hz/s.
Serial cascade interface, can receive and decode data through a signal line.
Transmission signal 5 meter without any increase circuit.
When the refresh rate is 30 frames per second, the number of cascades is not less than 1024 points.
Data transfer speed can reach 800Kbps
Color of the light is very consistent and cost-effective

**Connecting the Hardware**
First, connect the DHT11 sensor and the Neo Pixel ring to the Arduino Nano. The DHT11 sensor can be connected to any digital pin on the Arduino Nano. The Neo Pixel ring should be connected to the D2 pin of the Arduino Nano.

**Installing the Libraries**
You will need to install the DHT library and the Adafruit Neo Pixel library in your Arduino IDE. These libraries contain the necessary functions to interact with the DHT11 sensor and the Neo Pixel ring.

First Navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...

In the Library Manager, there is a search box. Type “DHT sensor library” into the search box.

In the search results, find the library named “DHT sensor library” by Adafruit. Click on it, then click the “Install” button.

And that’s it! You’ve successfully installed the DHT11 sensor library in Arduino IDE. This library should now be available for inclusion in your sketches.

**Programming the Arduino**
The next step is to program the Arduino Nano. The program should read the temperature from the DHT11 sensor and change the color of the Neo Pixel ring based on the temperature.

For example, you could program the Neo Pixel ring to display a blue color when the temperature is below a certain threshold.

A green color when the temperature is within a comfortable range,

and a red color when the temperature is above a certain threshold.

**Testing the System**
After programming the Arduino Nano, it’s time to test the system. Power up the Arduino and observe the color of the Neo Pixel ring. Try changing the temperature around the DHT11 sensor (for example, by blowing hot or cold air onto the sensor) and see if the color of the Neo Pixel ring changes accordingly.

Building a DHT11-controlled Neo Pixel ring with an Arduino Nano is a fun and educational project combining temperature sensing and visual feedback. With this system, you can visually monitor the temperature in a room and get a sense of whether the temperature is within a comfortable range.
